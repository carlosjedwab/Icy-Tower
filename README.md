# Icy-Tower
A game made inspired by the classic arcade game: Icy-Tower

Built with the SFML C++ library, which is necessary for running the game.

THIS IS NOT THE FINAL VERSION! PLUS THE MUSIC WAS TO BIG OF A FILE TO UPLOAD, SO FOR NOW THERE ISN'T A MUSIC!

# Running on Linux
With SFML installed, run the run.py script to open the game.
